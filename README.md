# Hidden-Markov-Model
A simple Hidden Markov Model from scratch.


* ### Given the data set containing the sequence of weather conditions and whether the umbrella is used or not we will build and train our Hidden Markov Model to predict the weather sequence for the next days given whether the Umbrella was used or not.
* ### The detailed step-by-step explanation can be found on the Jupyter Notebook.

#### Note: 
* #### The initial state for prediction is considered to be sunny.
